## Exercise 1

a) The first step is to generate two samples from a standard normal distribution - one with size 100 and one with size 1000000. These will be compared as histograms and QQ-plots and their respective mean and standard deviation will be computed

```{r}
# Generate samples
sample_a = rnorm(100)
sample_b = rnorm(1000000)

# Plots
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(sample_a)
hist(sample_b)
qqnorm(sample_a)
qqnorm(sample_b)
```


```{r}
mean_a = mean(sample_a)
mean_b = mean(sample_b)
sd_a = sd(sample_a)
sd_b = sd(sample_b)
df <- data.frame(mean=c(mean_a, mean_b),sd=c(sd_a, sd_b))
tab <- table(df, df)
tab
```

It is evident that the mean and standard deviation of the larger sample are closer to the true mean and standard deviation of the standard normal distribution, i.e. a higher statistical accuracy is achieved.

b) The probabilities for three example cases are computed for the standard normal distribution:

```{r}
print("Probabiliy that an arbitrary outcome is smaller than 2:")
pnorm(2)

print("Probabiliy that an arbitrary outcome is larger than -0.5:")
pnorm(-0.5, lower.tail = FALSE)

print("Probabiliy that an arbitrary outcome is between -1 and 2:")
pnorm(2) - pnorm(-1)
```
